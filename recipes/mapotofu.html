    <h1>Mapo Tofu</h1>
    <img src="../images/mapotofu.jpg">
    <p>Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan Province, where spicy food is king and the signature spice of the region––the Sichuan Peppercorn––gives dishes a unique “numbing” effect. It’s almost like the Sichuan peppercorns are there to not only add their fragrance and flavor, but also to numb your tongue so it can take more heat!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tofu</li>
        <li>Szechuan chillies</li>
        <li>Ground pork</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, we toast the chilies. If you have homemade toasted chili oil, you can skip this step. Heat your wok or a small saucepan over low heat. Add ¼ cup of the oil and throw in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir occasionally and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don’t burn. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining ¼ cup of oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the ginger. After 1 minute, add the garlic. </li>
        <li>Fry for another minute, and then turn up the heat to high and add the ground pork. Break up the meat and fry it until it’s cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add the ground Sichuan peppercorns.</li>
    </ol>
